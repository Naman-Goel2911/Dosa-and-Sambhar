To make the sambhar recipe-

To a pressure cooker, add the rinsed dal with 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 cups (24 oz) of water. Cook for 5 whistles on medium-high flame, then lower the heat to medium-low and let it cook for another 5 to 6 minutes. Once the pressure releases naturally, open the cooker and mash the cooked dal lightly with a potato masher. Set aside. If using an Instant Pot, pressure cook for 9 minutes on high pressure with natural pressure release.

Meanwhile soak 1 tablespoon tamarind piece in 1/3 cup of hot water for 15 to 20 minutes. Then strain the liquid using a strainer. You will get 3 to 4 tablespoons of tamarind water/juice. Set it aside.

In a pan, heat 2 teaspoons oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped eggplant and cook for around 2 minutes.

Add carrots and frozen drumsticks and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook for 2 more minutes. Add the chopped tomato and cook for 1 minute.

Then add around 3 cups (24 oz) water and stir.

Add 2 tablespoons sambar powder (or adjust to taste). Also add jaggery powder, and 4 tablespoons of the tamarind water that you had extracted earlier.

Stir in the cooked dal. Also add the kashmiri red chili powder, if using.

Stir everything together and let the sambar simmer on medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes.

For the tempering, heat 1 tablespoon ghee (or oil if you want to keep this vegan), in a small pan on medium heat. 

Once the ghee is hot, add mustard seeds and let them pop. Then add the hing and curry leaves for stir for few seconds until leaves turn crisp.

Pour tempering over the simmering sambar.

Serve the sambar hot with idli, dosa or rice!

To make the Dosa Recipe-

Make the batter
To a large bowl add sona masoori rice, idli rice, urad dal gota, chana dal, toor dal and methi seeds.
Rinse everything and soak in around 5 cups water for 5 to 6 hours.
Soak poha in 1/2 cup water 20 to 30 minutes before grinding the batter.
Drain water from the rice, dals & poha and transfer everything to a high speed blender.
Add around 1 & 1/4 cups (10 oz/300 ml) + 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 ml) cold water or as needed to grind the batter to a smooth paste (total water around 315-330 ml).
The amount of water needed will depend on the type of rice/dal you use, so it might change. So start with a lesser amount and adjust accordingly.
I use the smoothie button on my blendtec or the soup button to grind the batter.
Now, transfer the batter to the steel bowl of your Instant Pot.
Add 1 teaspoon of rock salt (sendha namak) to the batter. Do not use regular iodine salt here. If you live in a warm place, you may skip the salt at this point.
Using your hands, mix the salt into the batter for 2 minutes. This helps in fermentation.
The consistency of the batter should be free flowing, but it shouldnâ€™t be runny and it shouldn't be thick either, a thick batter won't ferment.
Now, you need to place the batter in a warm place to ferment. If you live in a warm place, just leave the batter to ferment over the counter.
If you live in a cold place, you can either place the batter in the oven (with oven lights on, but oven switched off) or use your Instant Pot!
To use the Instant Pot to ferment the batter, place the batter into the steel container on the Instant Pot.
And then press the yogurt button. Set time to 8 to 9 hours in summer and 13 to 14 hours in winters. Cover the pot with a glass lid (do not use the IP lid here since the batter might over-ferment and that will block the lid). This time may vary depending on where you live.
After 14 hours, my batter was well fermented. It had increased in volume and was frothy on top.
To check, you can drop some batter into a bowl of water, it will float which means it's fermented. The batter is now ready to make dosas, set aside while you make the potato masala.

Make the potato masala

Boil the potatoes and then peel the skin and mash them. You can boil the potatoes using an Instant Pot (high pressure 10 minutes) or 8-9 whistles on a stove-top pressure cooker.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add mustard seeds and let them pop.
Add hing and stir.
Add the chana dal (I usually soak it in water for 10 minutes, drain water and then use in the recipe), cashews and chopped ginger.
Saute until chana dal, cashews and ginger start changing color.
Then add the sliced onion, chopped green chilies and curry leaves. Cook the onions for around 2 minutes until soften.
Add the boiled and mashed potatoes along with turmeric and salt. Mix to combine everything.
If the masala is too dry, you can add few teaspoons of water here to make it a little water-y. I always add some.
Turn off heat, add some chopped cilantro and remove pan from heat.

Make the dosa

Heat a cast iron skillet on medium-high heat. I have used a 14-inch cast iron pan here (it is what works best for crisp dosa but you may use a non-stick pan). To check if pan is hot enough, sprinkle some water on the pan, the water should sizzle away and evaporate immediately.
Cut an onion, insert a fork in it and then dip the onion in some oil. Use than onion to rub the pan with oil.
Then start making the dosa. Take a ladle full of batter and pour it in the center of the pan.
Start spreading the batter by moving your ladle in circular motion in one direction.
Start from the inside and move your ladle out in a circular motion (move the ladle in clockwise direction).
Keep moving the ladle in circular motion and spreading the batter until the batter is well spread. Try to spread it as thin as possible. See picture above.
This comes with practice, so don't worry if you can't get a hang of it right away.
Drizzle oil or ghee all around the dosa and also in the center. Let the dosa cook for few minutes until the bottom starts appearing golden brown. You only need to cook one side of the dosa.
Add the prepared potato masala (few tablespoons of it) on one side if you wish to fold it or in the center if you want to roll the dosa.
You can also skip this step and serve masala on the side if you want. 
Then scrape the sides of the dosa to release it from the pan. Fold over one side of the dosa onto the side with the potato masala. If you put the masala in the center, then roll the dosa like you would roll a paper.
Press with a spatula and then remove dosa from the pan. Make all dosas in the same way. You will make around 12 to 15 dosa from the batter, more or less depending on how big or small you make them.
Remember after making each dosa, wipe the pan with a damp cloth, then rub with an onion dipped in oil or lightly grease the pan and then make the next dosa.
Serve crispy masala dosa hot with sambar, cilantro coconut chutney or tomato chutney!
